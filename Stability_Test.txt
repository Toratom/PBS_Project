Test done with detail duck with the following parameters :
  - Shape matching stiffness 0.01
  - Epilogue 2
  - Friction Ground 1, 0.2
  - Friction Particles 1, 1

Nb of Ducks - dt - Nb of iterations - Resut

1 - 3e-3 - 1 - YES
1 - 8e-3 - 1 - YES but there is a lot more deformations
Idea of explenation : as dt is bigger the deltaXs are bigger and as consequence the deformation due to the ground is bigger,
(half of the body can be inside the ground, and so deformed whereasthe top half still outside and not defromed). One iteration
of step matching cannot resolve this big deformation
1 - 8e-3 - 25 - YES but there is still some deformation and strange sliding artefact
Idea of explenation : the alternance of shape matching deplacement and ground collision deplacement create the sliding
Shape matching gives a deplacement a bit horizontale and going in the ground which is corrected by the collision by only a deplacement horizontal
1 - 8e-3 - 50 - YES but strange sliding artefact
1 - 3e-2 - 25 - YES but lot of deformation and strange sliding artefact
1 - 3e-2 - 50 - YES but lot of deformation and strange sliding artefact
1 - 3e-2 - 200 - YES but strange sliding artefact
1 - 3e-1 UNSTABLE either too much deformation the duck becomes flat or just garbage
Idea of explenation : all the duck in one step goes throught the ground

2 - 3e-3 - 1 - YES
1 - 8e-3 - 25 - YES but collision not solve...
Idea of explenation as dt is bigger the ellipsoids has the time to go to the other side of another ellispoid in one step
Solution test the collision of the ray
